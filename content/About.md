With more than four years experience in scientific computing followed by more than a year's industrial experience in tech industry, I manage compliance projects and lead the Quality Assurance Team at [YuJa](https://www.yuja.com/) helping build leading technology solutions for higher education enterprises.

I come from Lucknow, India, where I spent most of my childhood. I completed my undergraduate in 2016 from [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), majoring in Geological Technology. I moved to Canada in 2016 for my PhD program at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/). Following my graduation, I switched to tech industry to solve some real-world problems using software solutions.    

In my free time, I am learning Java to build software applications. Apart from my study, I like dabbling with guitar, writing poetry, philosophical prose, short stories, and sketching manga drawings.
