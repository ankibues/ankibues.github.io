I decided to give myself a new year gift of a personal website, a digital place where I can share my ideas, learnings, lessons, innovations, art, music and whatever there is to offer. After a whole lot of procrastinating, I decided to try out the new website in Hugo. Starting with a pretty [simple theme](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) , I intend to modify it to create something of my own.

This is a digital place of freedom and I will talk about everything I can: geology, math, guitar, philosophy, writing or tech stuff. I am trying to start making notes more seriously using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and will hope to churn out some valuable content out of it. I'll talk about it in a later posts! 

Please feel free to look around and don't hesitate to comment or contact me with any questions you have.

Peace,
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
