### Compliance Project Management
Over the past one and a half year, I have worked on many compliance projects at YuJa. Compliance simply means making sure that the software and software development practices are in accordance to relevant industry standards, such as accessibility, security, interoperability, etc. For this purpose, I have facilitated audits like:

* [SOC-2 and SOC-3](https://www.aicpa.org/resources/landing/soc-2-and-soc-3)
* [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html)
* 1EdTech (Formerly known as IMS Global) [LTI Advantage](http://www.imsglobal.org/lti-advantage-overview) and [Caliper Analytics](http://www.imsglobal.org/activity/caliper)

And maintained documentations such as:
* [HECVAT](https://library.educause.edu/resources/2020/4/higher-education-community-vendor-assessment-toolkit) for assessing security risks in cloud services 
* [VPAT](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat) for accessibility reports


### Automation Testing Using Selenium Framework
Over the past one and a half year, I have been working as a Quality Assurance Engineer at YuJa. With manual testing of software and hardware application already in practice, last year we decided to switch to automation to meet the growing needs of testing at YuJa. We have been developing automated test cases for [YuJa EVP](https://www.yuja.com/show/), which is a web-based platform that enables educational institutions to store, manage, distribute and stream media content. 
\
\
We use [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) based [TestNg](https://testng.org/doc/) framework in Java for automating the test scenarios such as uploading video/audio files, perrform certain types of actions on media files, creating different types of users, etc.
