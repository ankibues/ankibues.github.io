# **Software Development**

## Revealer:


[Revealer](https://play-revealer.com) is an educational game that provides user with a hidden picture associated with a weekly theme, and user has to guess what the picture is. Based on the principles of gamification and interactive play, this game is intends to help increase user's general knowledge about the world. 

Inspired by the Wordle-like games which he enjoys playing with her partner, Ankit designed and developed this web-game, that utilizes MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJs) stack hosted on AWS servers to provide simple yet elegant user interface.

## Shopify App Development: 

Ankit is consulting a start-up to build custom Shopify application for their online store.

# **Compliance**

While working in the Educational Technology (Ed-Tech) industry, Ankit managed many compliance projects. Compliance means making sure that the software and software development practices are in accordance to relevant industry standards of accessibility, security, and interoperability, etc. 

Ankit believes that compliance is a great strategy for building a great product that leads to greater customer satisfaction!

Below are some Compliance Certifications Ankit has managed during his tenure at YuJa:

* [SOC-2 and SOC-3](https://www.aicpa.org/resources/landing/soc-2-and-soc-3)
* [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html)
* 1EdTech (Formerly known as IMS Global) [LTI Advantage](http://www.imsglobal.org/lti-advantage-overview) and [Caliper Analytics](http://www.imsglobal.org/activity/caliper)

And maintainting documentations such as:
* [HECVAT](https://library.educause.edu/resources/2020/4/higher-education-community-vendor-assessment-toolkit) for assessing security risks in cloud services 
* [VPAT](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat) for accessibility reports

As part of his Compliance efforts, Ankit has provided security, product testing and other compliance training (e.g. Incident response) to engineering, customer success and customer support teams.  


# **Test Automation**

Ankit worked as a Quality Assurance Engineer at YuJa. With manual testing of software and hardware application already in practice, he led the automation development to meet the growing needs of testing at YuJa. This involved developing automated test cases for [YuJa EVP](https://www.yuja.com/show/), which is a web-based platform that enables educational institutions to store, manage, distribute and stream media content. 
\
\
This project utilized [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) based [TestNg](https://testng.org/doc/) framework in Java for automating the test scenarios such as uploading video/audio files, perrform certain types of actions on media files, creating different types of users, etc. 


# **Original Research** 

# **Pressure variation in Earth's heterogeneous rocks** 

Pressure in a rock element in Earth's lithosphere may vary from its ambient value and if 
significant, may influence the physical processes. This poses major problems in 
routine use of pressure as a proxy for depth in geodynamic models. Ankit developed and applied 
physics-based numerical models to simulate pressure deviation in a rheologically distinct rock element in 
an ambient rock medium of a non-linear viscous anisotropic rheology. 

Investigations in this project revealed that the pressure deviations in a rock element are in the same order as the deviatoric stress levels and hence limited by the strength of rocks. Following figure shows one such example of pressure fields around a heterogeneous element with a different viscosity than the surrounding rocks. The pressure values are normalized with respect to far field stresses.

# **Quartz crystal fabrics in Earth's multiscale lithosphere**

Flow variation in quartz aggregates of natural high strain zones in Earth's lithosphere can influence the development of crystallographic fabric and cause problems in its interpretation. If such effect is not accounted for, crucial geological information such as deformation temperature, deformation history and shear sense obtained using crystallographic fabric can be seriously misinterpreted. Ankit developed and applied a multiscale model coupling [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)-based MOPLA code with the [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/en/)-based VPSC code to simulate the quartz crystallographic fabric under partitioned flow. It was found that the quartz c-axis fabric variation showing apparent opposite senses of shear within a single thin section, can be explained by partitioned flow within the quartz domains and reflect finite strain gradient rather than reversal of vorticity sense as previously thought. Following image shows the quartz crystal fabric changing with increase in strain intensity. This only happens when quartz aggregates are rheologically stronger than the surrounding rockmass.

# **Flanking structures in Earth's lithosphere**

Flow variation around a rheological heterogeneity (also known as a cutting element) such as a dyke, can form flanking structures, which if interpreted incorrectly, can cause problems in understanding regional plate tectonics. This project developed a new model to simulate 3-D flanking structures and demonstrate how flanking structures vary with viscosity, 3-D shape and orientation of cutting element, and finite strains. The following example simulations shows the how different flanking structure might develop around a rock element depending upon its intial orientation.
