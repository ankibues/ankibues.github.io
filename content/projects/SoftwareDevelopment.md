## QuestEd: 

[QuestEd](https://github.com/quest-Ed/QuestEd) is an open-source educational technology platform enabling instructors to craft story-driven, gamified learning experiences with Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

Instructors can create interactive gamified learning experience by adding keywords or even a lesson plan (in the form of pdf, or document file). Using generative AI, QuestEd develops a story-based learning experience called Quest, that can be accessed by a learner.

The learning experience is provided by Questy, an AI learning assistant that guides the learner through their learning quests, and help them solve problems and challenges as they appear in the learning experience.

The project uses MERN (MongoDB, express, React and NodeJs) stack along with Google's Gemini AI models. Future work would incorporate other LLMs(Large Language Models) as well.

## Revealer:


[Revealer](https://play-revealer.com) is an open-source educational game that provides user with an interactive learning experience. A hidden picture associated with a weekly theme is added every day and user has to guess what the picture is. 
Based on the principles of gamification and interactive play, this game intends to help increase user's general knowledge about the world. 

Inspired by the Wordle-like games which he enjoys playing with her partner, Ankit designed and developed this web-game, that utilizes MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJs) stack hosted on AWS servers to provide simple yet elegant user interface.
