You could have thought of many more words than me, or may be not. Feel free to comment below how many emotions you could name.</p><p>But, if you are able to think more number of emotion words than me, it means you are more emotionally granular than me.</p><p>Emotional granularity is our ability to differentiate and categorize emotion concepts. The more number of words we can use to describe our emotion states, the more emotionally granular we are.</p><p>But wait, the question I asked earlier was, “How emotional you are?”. Turns out, it’s an irrelevant question to ask.</p><p>If you have seen the Disney movie “Inside Out”, where the little girl has all sorts of emotion characters playing inside her head, then here is a bummer for you. That’s not how our brain works. Emotions are not inherent. They are constructed by our brains based on our experiences.</p><p>Remembering more names of emotions means that you have more refined concepts of emotions in your mind. So in a way you can say, you are more emotionally granular than others.</p><p>But, to answer the question, are you emotional?</p><p>Yes, everyone is. Emotions are our goal-based perceptions of the inner bodily processes going on in our biological machine that is made of our central nervous system and our body.</p><p>The way you think of ‘Anger’ and how it occurs in your brain in the form of neurochemical reaction is totally different from how it happens in mine or any other individual.</p><p>Why should I care about it?</p><p>Our society is full of prejudices and misconceptions. For example,</p><p>“Women are more emotional than Men.”</p><p>This is a classic piece of bullshit, according to the findings of neuroscience. And this is just one example.</p><p>In our daily lives, we construct so many biases about other individuals of our society based on their sex, religion, color, etc. Understanding of how we form emotion concepts is therefore of prime and utmost importance for the well-being of our society.</p><p>Thanks for reading my stuff! 🙂</p></div><footer><div class=comments><script>let getTheme=window.localStorage&&window.localStorage.getItem("colorscheme");getTheme=getTheme??"github-light";let theme=getTheme==="dark"?"github-dark":"github-light",s=document.createElement("script");s.src="https://utteranc.es/client.js",s.setAttribute("repo","ankibues/bhandlab.github.io"),s.setAttribute("issue-term","pathname"),s.setAttribute("theme",theme),s.setAttribute("crossorigin","anonymous"),s.setAttribute("async",""),document.querySelector("div.comments").innerHTML="",document.querySelector("div.comments").appendChild(s)</script></div></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
