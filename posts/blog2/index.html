She asks me, “Who do you think you are, mister?”, and I jokingly reply to her, “I am the Universe!”. And we laugh it away.</p><p>But, there seems to be a certain truth about that statement. From a perspective, I am the Universe. And so are You.</p><p>Our scientific understanding of the universe tells us the story of how the big bang created this spacetime continuum, which seems to be billions of years old. Matter somehow came into existence in the form of particles, which then formed into elements, atoms, molecules, and then complex compounds. Life might have originated on Earth in the form of single-celled organisms, and evolved further into complex animals, eventually leading to the animals with brains, capable of creating concepts and manipulating information (that’s us!).</p><p>As famous Astrophysicist Carl Sagan would say,</p><p><em><strong>“We are made of star-stuff”</strong></em></p><p>our bodies are made of substances that have originated from the materials that make stars, or any other celestial bodies.</p><p>Journeying back in time:
Generally, when we think about ourselves, we think from our perspective. Who am I? I am my body, my mind, and organs. But, why should we think that way? What if we simply go back in time?</p><p>Let’s say when we were a baby. Or let’s say when we were a single-celled organism inside our mother’s womb. Before that period in time, we didn’t even exist. But, our parents did. And before them, their parents did. Over the years, the genetic material has kept on transferring information over generations. Ten thousands years back in time and our ancestors were hunters and gatherers roaming around the planet.</p><p>Keep going back in time, and there will come a time when some form of material came out of chemicals, that was capable of replicating itself (and hence possibly originating life as we know it). Where does that chemical come from? From the Universe itself.</p><p><em><strong>We are not in the universe, but are the universe.</strong></em></p><p>Imagine the universe as a human body. We (humans) might be the tip of the fingernails. Now, you won’t point at your fingernail, and say that this is someone else. Your fingernail is still a part of you, and in fact, it is you. Similarly, aren’t we, the humans, the universe itself?</p><p>The fact that we are able to think about all this is mind-blowing and fascinating, and perhaps should be left for later stories. What my point here is that you and I are all actually one cosmic unit, or to be more precise, one being (that is the universe).</p><p><em><strong>The Idea of Oneness:</strong></em>
The idea of being one with the cosmos is not something new. Glimpses of these ideologies have been prevalent in both Eastern and Western philosophies for ages. Over the years, it has also become part of many religious and community activities. It might seem a bit intuitive, as one think about the nature of existence. You come into this world from nothingness, and that nothingness is universe itself. While you and I and every other human being in this world, are different individuals, we have a common link , that is we all are existing in this floating piece of rock, which we call “Earth”, and share a common ancestry to the chemicals that led to the origin of life millions of years ago.</p><p><em><strong>Why should I care?</strong></em>
Wait, so what? Why does it matter to me or you? Knowing the fact that I am the Universe, doesn’t help me earn my living. That’s for sure.</p><p>You have to create value in the current economy to earn a living. That’s how the present human civilization is. But, knowing who you truly are: “Billions of years old, system of chaos, matter and energy, which has manifested itself in the form of biological machines capable of understanding itself” gives you a Perspective.</p><p>Perspective to understand what this world is about. Who you truly are and what you are capable of? To know what your true value is, i.e. invaluable.</p><p>And more importantly, if you are someone going through a tough phase in life (which I bet many of us already do, as sadly that’s the current world we live in), this perspective can give you a moment of peace and reconciliation with yourself.</p><p>As they say,</p><p><em><strong>“Philosophy is the medicine for the soul”.</strong></em></p></div><footer><div class=comments><script>let getTheme=window.localStorage&&window.localStorage.getItem("colorscheme");getTheme=getTheme??"github-light";let theme=getTheme==="dark"?"github-dark":"github-light",s=document.createElement("script");s.src="https://utteranc.es/client.js",s.setAttribute("repo","ankibues/bhandlab.github.io"),s.setAttribute("issue-term","pathname"),s.setAttribute("theme",theme),s.setAttribute("crossorigin","anonymous"),s.setAttribute("async",""),document.querySelector("div.comments").innerHTML="",document.querySelector("div.comments").appendChild(s)</script></div></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
